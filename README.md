To use, run ruby bin/run. This app will tell you what foods pair well with specific wines. It will prompt you to answer the questions of what wine you would like to drink and then it will give you information regarding that wine and what it pairs well with. Afterward, you can type exit to exit, or you can type in another wine.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
