1 run bundle gem CLI_project 
2 Comment out gemspec in Gemfile 
    a. we only need a gemspec if we are going to actually turn this into a gem. 
3. Add gems (in our case pry and httparty) and run bundle install. 
4. Rename 'pokemon.rb' file to be 'environment.rb'
   a. Add required gems and AND files here. 
    i. We need to add the required gems here because using Bundler.setup will break the gem if we decide to make it an official gem. 
5. Add files for classes - namespace with module
